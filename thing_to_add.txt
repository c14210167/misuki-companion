THINGS TO ADD IN THE FUTURE

FIXES NEEDED
> Misuki always responds like she's sleepy (using sleepy emote and slow typing speed) when there's something related to sleep in her message, even if its just a mention.
> Misuki always responds with 3 messages. Is that what she wants? There's this one occasion when she responds with 4 messages, though. If 3 messages back to back is what she wants, then i guess there's no need to fix anything.
> The reminder doesnt work
> Make misuki remember the nicknames i gave her, maybe store it in a txt file

THINGS TO ADD
Misuki has different folders for different clothes for different occasions.
Misuki has clothes for when she wants to:
- Going to sleep, which is more limited clothing
- Going to college, which is a collared shirt and yellow cardigan with jeans
- 2 more different clothes for casual (different each day)

Make a txt file for core memories, but ensure that it works even if there's a lot inside
Misuki should be able to send selfies (pre-made)
